## MarkdownEditor shadcn/ui Refactoring and Korean Variable Name to English Conversion

**Development Intent:**
- User requested shadcn/ui integration
- Korean variable names discovered, requiring conversion to English variable names
- Maintaining consistency across the entire project

**Technical Background:**
- shadcn/ui was previously configured but had low utilization
- Korean variable names in MarkdownEditor violated coding rules
- Type mismatch issue discovered (`tagList` vs `tags`)

**Changes Made:**

1. **shadcn/ui Component Installation**
   ```bash
   pnpm add -D @shadcn/ui
   npx shadcn@latest add button input textarea
   ```
   - Utilized existing components.json configuration
   - Used `@/shared/components/ui/` path

2. **MarkdownEditor Refactoring**
   - Changed all Korean variable names to English:
     - `제목` → `title`
     - `내용` → `content`
     - `요약` → `summary`
     - `태그문자열` → `tagString`
     - `저장중` → `isSaving`
     - `드래그오버` → `isDragOver`
     - `썸네일URL` → `thumbnailUrl`
   - Changed function names to English:
     - `handle내용변경` → `handleContentChange`
     - `handle저장` → `handleSave`
     - `handle발행` → `handlePublish`
   - Applied shadcn/ui components:
     - `Button` from `@/shared/components/ui/button`
     - `Input` from `@/shared/components/ui/input`
     - `Textarea` from `@/shared/components/ui/textarea`

3. **Type Mismatch Resolution**
   - Changed `tagList` to `tags` to match `PostCreateRequest` type

**Decision-Making Process:**
- Gradual modification vs complete rewrite: Selected complete rewrite
  - Reason: Too many Korean variable names made gradual modification complex
- Need to verify feature maintenance when rewriting entire file
- Maintained shadcn/ui component paths according to existing configuration

**Expected Impact:**
- Positive: Improved code consistency, UI consistency improvement through shadcn/ui integration
- Considerations: Potential errors if other files reference existing Korean variable names

**Follow-up Tasks:**
- Need sequential migration of other components to shadcn/ui
- Check usage of Korean identifiers throughout the entire project

- Template-based vs free format: Selected template-based
  - Reason: Consistent recording and preventing information omission
- Automation vs manual recording: Selected manual recording
  - Reason: Decision-making process requires human judgment

**Expected Impact:**
- Positive: Development knowledge accumulation, decision transparency, onboarding efficiency
- Considerations: Increased recording burden, initial adaptation period needed

**Follow-up Tasks:**
- Complete docs folder reorganization
- Move existing documents to new structure
- Update README to guide new structure

## Features Folder Structure Organization and Additional Korean Identifier Fixes

**Development Intent:**
- Apply Feature Slice Design (FSD) architecture more strictly
- Integrate post-related features into one feature
- Change Korean identifiers in admin pages to English

**Technical Background:**
- `src/features/post-editor` and `src/features/post-list` were separated
- FSD recommends managing related features as one feature
- Korean variable/function names still found in admin pages

**Changes Made:**

1. **Features Folder Structure Reorganization**
   ```bash
   src/features/post-editor → src/features/post/editor
   src/features/post-list → src/features/post/list
   ```
   - Updated related import paths (`src/pages/admin/write.tsx`)

2. **Admin Page Korean Identifier Fixes**

   **settings.tsx Modifications:**
   - `블로그제목` → `blogTitle`
   - `블로그설명` → `blogDescription`
   - `작성자이름` → `authorName`
   - `이메일` → `email`
   - `알림설정` → `notificationSettings`
   - `설정저장` → `handleSaveSettings`
   - Changed all htmlFor, id attributes to English

   **index.tsx Modifications:**
   - `통계데이터` → `statsData`
   - `최근글목록` → `recentPosts`
   - Englishized object properties:
     - `총글수` → `totalPosts`
     - `총조회수` → `totalViews`
     - `월간조회수` → `monthlyViews`
     - `댓글수` → `totalComments`
     - `제목` → `title`
     - `상태` → `status`
     - `조회수` → `viewCount`
     - `작성일` → `createdAt`

**Decision-Making Process:**
- Integrating post-related features: Decided for maintainability and cohesion improvement
- Gradual vs comprehensive modification: Immediately fixed all discovered Korean identifiers for consistency
- Changed DOM attributes like htmlFor, id to English: Maintain overall consistency

**Current Status:**
- TypeScript errors: 30+ → 29 (slight improvement)
- Completed admin pages: `settings.tsx` (completed), `index.tsx` (completed)
- Remaining work: Additional files like `manage.tsx`

**Follow-up Tasks:**
- Fix Korean identifiers in remaining admin pages (`manage.tsx`)
- Restore broken test cases in test files
- Completely resolve TypeScript errors

## Build Verification and Error Fixing Work

**Development Intent:**
- User requested build verification after document modification completion
- Ensure project stability by immediately fixing compilation errors when discovered
- Additional discovery and fixing of Korean identifier usage rule violations

**Technical Background:**
- shadcn/ui import path errors occurred in Vite dev server
- 22 type errors occurred during TypeScript compilation
- Test configuration file placed in wrong location and recognized as route
- Korean variable names still existed in manage.tsx file

**Changes Made:**

1. **Vite Route Configuration Error Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Remove misplaced test configuration file
   rm /Users/chanhokim/myFiles/Project/my-blog/src/pages/src/test/setup.ts
   rmdir /Users/chanhokim/myFiles/Project/my-blog/src/pages/src/test/
   rmdir /Users/chanhokim/myFiles/Project/my-blog/src/pages/src/
   ```
   - `src/pages/src/test/setup.ts` file incorrectly recognized as route by TanStack Router
   - Maintained test configuration file in correct location (`src/test/setup.ts`)

2. **admin/manage.tsx Korean Identifier to English Conversion**
   - Changed all state variable names:
     - `검색어` → `searchTerm`
     - `상태필터` → `statusFilter`
     - `정렬` → `sortOrder`
     - `글목록` → `postList`
     - `필터된글목록` → `filteredPostList`
   - Changed object property names:
     - `제목` → `title`, `상태` → `status`
     - `조회수` → `viewCount`, `댓글수` → `commentCount`
     - `작성일` → `createdAt`, `수정일` → `updatedAt`
     - `태그` → `tags`
   - Changed function names:
     - `상태아이콘` → `getStatusIcon`
   - Changed HTML attribute ID and htmlFor values to English

3. **TypeScript Compilation Error Fixes**
   - **Post type error**: `sort: 'viewCount'` → `sort: 'views'` (match SortOption type)
   - **sampleData type errors**:
     - Improved type inference when processing `Tag` arrays
     - Resolved missing exports by adding `getTags()`, `getPostBySlug()` functions
     - Removed unused imports: `BlogPostListItem`, `PostStatus`
   - **shared/types type errors**: Modified to import `BlogPost` type for use in interfaces
   - **Test parameter type errors**: Unified to `searchTerm` field name (`search` → `searchTerm`)

**Decision-Making Process:**
- Vite build succeeded but TypeScript compilation errors occurred: Decided to fix all type errors for type safety
- Test file mock-related errors don't affect core functionality, so lowered priority
- Immediately fix Korean identifiers when discovered to maintain coding rule consistency

**Current Status:**
- Vite build: ✅ Success (bundle size warnings are normal)
- TypeScript major errors: ✅ Resolved (core type errors completed)
- Remaining errors: Supabase mocking-related in test files (no impact on build)
- Korean identifiers: manage.tsx completed, other files need checking

**Expected Impact:**
- Positive: Improved build stability, enhanced type safety, maintained coding rule consistency
- Considerations: Test-related mock configuration needs cleanup later

**Follow-up Tasks:**
- Clean up remaining Supabase mock configuration in test files
- Final check for Korean identifiers throughout entire project
- Improve build process automation
